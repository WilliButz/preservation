# Preservation

Nix tooling to enable declarative management of non-volatile system state.

Inspired and heavily influenced by [impermanence](https://github.com/nix-community/impermanence) but not
meant to be a drop-in replacement.

## Documentation

Docs are available at <https://willibutz.github.io/preservation>

## Work in Progress

ðŸš§ still under construction ðŸš§

Check out [the test](tests/basic.nix) for a usage example ðŸ‘€

Depends on <https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/307528> (merged, available on nixos-unstable).

## Why?

This aims to provide a declarative state management solution for NixOS systems without resorting to
interpreters to do the heavy lifting. This should enable impermanence-like state management on
an "interpreter-less" NixOS system.
